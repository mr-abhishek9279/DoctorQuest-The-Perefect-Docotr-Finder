                <h2>Protect Your Eyesight with Dilated Eye Exams</h2>
                <p>From the moment you wake up until you go to sleep, your eyes are working to bring you the world,
                    delivering 80% of the information you take in every day. In return, the least you can do is protect
                    and monitor them.

                    Yet, according to the National Eye Institute (NEI), more than 24 million American adults have never
                    had an eye exam.

                    Maybe that's because when your eyes feel healthy, it's easy to assume they are healthy. But did you
                    know your eyes are windows to your overall health? And the best way to get a complete picture is
                    with regular dilated eye exams..</p>

                <h2>Mallet Finger: What It Is and How to Treat It</h2>
                <p>Mallet finger, also known as baseball finger, is an injury to the last joint on your finger that
                    causes a deformity where the finger appears crooked or drooping. Mallet finger is most often caused
                    by an object forcefully hitting the fingertip and bending the joint too far, which can result in a
                    torn or detached tendon or even a broken bone.

                    It is commonly seen in athletes who play sports that involve catching a ball, like baseball,
                    basketball, volleyball, or football. However, this injury can happen to anyone, even if you’re just
                    doing a mundane task like making the bed or loading the washing machine. Any action that causes the
                    joint to be forcefully bent can cause mallet finger.</p>

                <h2>Five Simple Steps to Better Sleep</h2>
                <p>MIf you're struggling to fall asleep at night, you're not alone. The busy pace of modern life can
                    leave us feeling tired but wired. Here are five small changes you can make to get back on track.
                    Those wakeful nights could be caused by an erratic sleep schedule. Every day—including weekends and
                    holidays—schedule a bedtime and wake-up time to reset your body’s internal time clock, also known as
                    circadian rhythm.
                    Working, talking on the phone, or watching TV in the bedroom can wreak havoc on your sleep cycle.
                    Turn your bedroom into a sleeping oasis by removing all digital devices and keeping the space cool,
                    calm, and comfortable.
                    It’s no secret that exercise boosts your overall health, including sleep. Just make sure to schedule
                    your harder workouts earlier in the day to give your body enough time to transition into relaxation
                    mode. Reserve lighter activities, such as yoga, for the evening.

                <h2>What to Do When Concussion Symptoms Won’t Go Away</h2>
                <p>Apr 17, 2024
                    Concussion recovery can sometimes be a frustrating, confusing process. Just when you think you're on
                    the mend, a persistent symptom will start nagging at you once again. If you suffered a serious blow
                    to the head and experience symptoms weeks or months after the fact, you may have post-concussion
                    syndrome (PCS).

                    Despite the unsettling terminology, this is a fairly common condition—even among young athletes—and
                    a vast majority of patients can expect a full recovery with treatment.

                    "Don't get too hung up on the term 'syndrome' because post-concussion syndrome is highly treatable
                    and patients will recover,” says Colby Hansen, MD, associate professor in the Department of Physical
                    Medicine & Rehabilitation at University of Utah Health. “Even if your symptoms aren't going away,
                    there is still a path forward to feeling well and being well."</p>

                <h2>Take Control of Your Health During Men's Health Month</h2>
                <p>June is Men's Health Month, making it a great time for men to schedule preventive health checkups.
                    Only three out of five men get an annual physical and more than 40% of men only go to the doctor
                    when they have a serious medical condition.

                    'We'd like to see a change in those statistics," says James Hotaling, MD, a urologist and director
                    of Men's Health at University of Utah Health. "The majority of health issues men face are more
                    treatable and more manageable in the early stages."


                    "I encourage men to take control of their overall health, including their sexual health, which is
                    frequently linked to other, sometimes serious, health issues.'</p>

                <h2>Can I Become a Living Organ Donor?</h2>
                <p>Becoming a living organ donor is one of the most selfless things a person can do. In 2023, 6,953
                    lives were saved thanks to living donors. However, more than 100,000 people are still on the
                    national transplant waiting list, with 86% of those people in need of a kidney.

                    Those on the transplant waiting list can potentially avoid the long wait times for organs from a
                    deceased donor if a living donor is available. Living organ donations have medical advantages as
                    well.

                    “We know from years of research that living donor organs last longer and do better than deceased
                    organ transplants,” says Shalei Valentine, BSN, the Living Donor Transplant Coordinator at
                    University of Utah Health. “Deceased donor kidney transplants last about 10 to 15 years on average,
                    while living kidney donor transplants last 15 to 20 years on average.”
